== Version 4.0.0

After even more years of development the landscape of build systems has changed
considerably, and so has the landscape of compilers. This version marks the
start of B2 transitioning to a {CPP} implementation. Initially this means that
the engine will be compiled as C++ source but that source is still the base
C implementation. Over time it will transform to a {CPP} code base in both the
engine and build system. Some changes in this start:

* Requires {CPP} 11 to build engine.
* Simplified build scripts to make it easier to maintain.
* Building with {CPP} optimizations gives an immediate performance improvement.
